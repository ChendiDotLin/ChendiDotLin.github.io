title: My PlayWright Career ehh
---
As Carnegie Mellon University is famous for its top Computer Science College and Drama School, I am also trying to persue a career towards Emmy Award (not really).

For now, I have only finished one 15-minute 1-act play, called "_Death Control_". Please reach out to me if you are interested in taking a sneak.

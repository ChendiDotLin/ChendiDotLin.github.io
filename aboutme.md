### My Robot Side
This is the section I am the least willing to write, so I purposely left it blank since I created my personal website. Describing myself formally is always awkward and I don't have the flowery language to make it vivid and poetic. But here we are, despite of the reluctance, because that is what life is about.

I am currently leading Trajectory Selection Component at AutoX, an autonomous driving startup based in the Bay Area. Previously I work as a software engineer at Waymo, also an self driving company backed by Alphabet. I also worked at MathWorks in the Simulink Code Inspector team, where I helped ensure that user-generated Simulink models could be deployed on hardware like automobiles and airplanes safely and efficiently.

I hold a Master's degree in Robotics from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I conducted research on motion planning and task allocation for heterogeneous multi-robot systems under the supervision of Prof. Katia Sycara. During a summer break, I interned with Uber ATG's motion planning team, focusing on trajectory optimization. You can find details about my thesis work and related publications on this website.

I received my B.S. degree in Engineering Mechanics, with minors in both Computer Science and Mathematics, from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2018. I had the honor to work with Prof. James Allison, Prof. Randy Ewoldt, and Prof. Elif Ertekin on various topics like structural optimization, visco-elastic material design, and shape memory alloy simulation and design. I published two conference papers as the first author during my college years, which are also listed under the _Publication_ tab.

### My Human Side
When I'm not working on robotics and optimization, I indulge in my artsy side projects like photography, pixel art, and playwriting. You can find them under the _Here and There_ tab. I also occasionally post technical blogs under the _Tech_ section of this tab.
